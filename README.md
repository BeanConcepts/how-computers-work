- Using failure as a feedback is an important skill both in IT and in life.
### Course Introduction
- The guidance system that navigated the spacecraft was one of the earliest forms of modern computing. 
- Computer hardware and software have had such a dramatic evolution that what was once only used to power rockets, now shapes the entire way our world functions. 
- We'll also spend time learning about how applications and programs tie all of this together, and let humans interact with these systems.
- Whether you're looking for a job in the IT industry or you just want to learn higher laptop connects to the Internet, understanding how computers work at every level can help you in your day-to-day life and in the workplace.
## The Modern Computer

### Module Introduction
-  I worked as an IT consultant to decommission an entire IT environment. 
-  Starting at Google as an IT generalist allowed me to experience many different areas of technology.
-  You'll be able to describe all the physical parts of a computer and how they work together. 
 ### Introduction to Computer Hardware
 - The CPU does all the calculations and data processing.
 - RAM is our computer's short-term memory.
 - It holds everything in place and lets our components communicate with each other.
 ### Programs and Hardware
-  Remember that our computer can only communicate in binary, using ones and zeroes.
-  The chef is our CPU, she processes the recipes we send her and makes the food.
-  RAM can hold millions, even billions, of rows of data.
-  Cache is smaller than RAM, but it let's us store data that we use often, and let's us quickly reference it.
## What's an Operating system?

### Module Introduction
- it's essential to understand how operating systems work so you can help someone accomplish the task they set out to do,
### Remote Connection and SSH
- You use this connection to log into your computer at home, and just as if you are sitting at home, you're able to grab the file from your desktop and copy it to your laptop.
- Remote connection makes working in an IT support role much easier since it allows us to manage multiple machines from anywhere in the world.
- To use SSH, you need to have an SSH client installed on the computer you're connecting from along with an SSH server on the computer you're trying to connect to.
- A VPN is a virtual private network. It allows you to connect to a private network like your work network over the Internet.  
### Remote Connections on Windows
- The ability to make remote connections is equally useful on Windows computers.
- Then tell it you want to connect via SSH by adding the -SSH option. You can also provide the user an address in the form of user at IP address and specifying the port at the end. 
- SSH can be super useful especially if you want to connect from a computer running Windows to Linux-based operating system running remotely.
