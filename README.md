# Technical Support Fundamentals
## Introduction to IT Support

### Program Introduction
- There are hundreds of thousands of IT support jobs just waiting for skilled candidates to fill them.
- This program is designed to give you the foundational skills and confidence required for an entry level IT support role. 
- If you dedicate around eight to 10 hours a week to the courses, we anticipate that you'll complete the certificate in about eight months.
- Another really cool part about this program is that it's been created entirely by real world pros who have a strong background in IT support
 ### What is IT?
- Information technology has completely transformed your life in ways that you may not even realize.
- IT is essentially the use of digital technology, like computers and the internet, to store and process data into useful information.
- IT helps people solve meaningful problems by using technology.
### What does an IT Support Specialist do?
- it varies a ton, based on whether you're doing in personal or remote, support and at a small business or a large enterprise company.
- Being an IT generalist also gave me the flexibility to learn and practice so many different skills and eventually determined where I want to focus my career.
- Using failure as a feedback is an important skill both in IT and in life.
### Course Introduction
- The guidance system that navigated the spacecraft was one of the earliest forms of modern computing. 
- Computer hardware and software have had such a dramatic evolution that what was once only used to power rockets, now shapes the entire way our world functions. 
- We'll also spend time learning about how applications and programs tie all of this together, and let humans interact with these systems.
- Whether you're looking for a job in the IT industry or you just want to learn higher laptop connects to the Internet, understanding how computers work at every level can help you in your day-to-day life and in the workplace.
## The Modern Computer

### Module Introduction
-  I worked as an IT consultant to decommission an entire IT environment. 
-  Starting at Google as an IT generalist allowed me to experience many different areas of technology.
-  You'll be able to describe all the physical parts of a computer and how they work together. 
 ### Introduction to Computer Hardware
 - The CPU does all the calculations and data processing.
 - RAM is our computer's short-term memory.
 - It holds everything in place and lets our components communicate with each other.
 ### Programs and Hardware
-  Remember that our computer can only communicate in binary, using ones and zeroes.
-  The chef is our CPU, she processes the recipes we send her and makes the food.
-  RAM can hold millions, even billions, of rows of data.
-  Cache is smaller than RAM, but it let's us store data that we use often, and let's us quickly reference it.
## What's an Operating system?

### Module Introduction
- it's essential to understand how operating systems work so you can help someone accomplish the task they set out to do,
### Remote Connection and SSH
- You use this connection to log into your computer at home, and just as if you are sitting at home, you're able to grab the file from your desktop and copy it to your laptop.
- Remote connection makes working in an IT support role much easier since it allows us to manage multiple machines from anywhere in the world.
- To use SSH, you need to have an SSH client installed on the computer you're connecting from along with an SSH server on the computer you're trying to connect to.
- A VPN is a virtual private network. It allows you to connect to a private network like your work network over the Internet.  
### Remote Connections on Windows
- The ability to make remote connections is equally useful on Windows computers.
- Then tell it you want to connect via SSH by adding the -SSH option. You can also provide the user an address in the form of user at IP address and specifying the port at the end. 
- SSH can be super useful especially if you want to connect from a computer running Windows to Linux-based operating system running remotely. 
### Components of an Operating System
- The kernel is the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our systems resources. As users, we don't interact with the kernel directly. 
- If you're able to understand the basic building blocks of one OS, you can apply that to any operating system and understand how it works.
- The kernel does file storage in file management.
- The user space is everything outside the kernel.
### Files and File Systems
- The kernel handles file storage and file systems on our machines. 
- This way our operating system can read and write data to it.
### Process Management
- A process is a program that's executing, like our internet browser or text editor. 
- This process needs to have harder resources like RAM and CPU.
- The CPU execute one process in milliseconds then executes another process then another.
### Memory Management
- Virtual memory is a combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use. 
- If we want to read and execute these pages, they have to be sent to physical memory or RAM.
- When we store our virtual memory on our hard drive, we call the allocated space, swap space. 
### I/O Management
- We refer to devices that perform input and output, as I/O devices. 
- These I/O devices are all managed by our kernel.
- I/O doesn't just mean the transfer of data between us and our devices.
### Interacting with the OS: User Space
- A graphical user interface or GUI, is a visual way to interact with a computer. 
- People usually recognize a device or product based on its GUI. 
### Logs
- Logs or files that record system events on our computer. 
- logs are kept so we can refer back to them when we need to find out something that happened.
### The Boot Process
- The POST performs a series of diagnostic tests to make sure that the computer is in proper working order. 
-  The bootloader is a small program that loads the operating system.
### Mobile Operating Systems
- General-purpose mob ile devices generally use a mobile operating system that's derived from other operating systems.
- Mobile operating systems are optimized to use as little power as possible.
### Cindy Drive & Career Path
- Technology is a real equalizer.

## Installing an Operating System

### Choosing an Operating System
- The operating systems in use by an organization have a lot to do with the applications and systems that they need to run.
- Modern operating systems do a pretty good job of supporting common hardware.
-  the operating system will continue from whatever point the vendor left it at.
-   As an IT support specialist, you'll install an operating system many times, so using one single disk won't be time efficient or scalable.
### Virtual Machines
- A virtual machine is just a copy of a real machine.
- Virtual machines use physical resources like memory, CPU and storage, but they offer the added benefit of running multiple operating systems at once. 
- Throughout this program, you'll actually be using VMs to perform hands-on exercises. 
### What is Chrome OS?
- Chrome OS has one main purpose: to be a secure and simple way for the user to interact with the web.
- It can also run Android and Linux applications inside containers
- Chrome OS has strong security, which we'll learn about in an upcoming course. 
### Introduction to Qwiklabs
- Qwiklabs is an online learning environment that takes you through live real-world scenarios you may encounter as an IT support specialist.
